# Armature Tools
Armature Tools can quickly generate and edit weighted bones.
<br>It is intended for, but not limited to simple meshes like hair-meshes/cards, tails, tubes, etc. (Also works for curves, but does not apply weights)
<br>Removing / editing weighted bones usually comes with extra work in weight painting, which this add-on aim's to speed up significantly.

# Note:
Files were made to be injected into a class through Serpens(Add-on), where the UI is made.

I don't reccomend keeping everything in one file like I've done here as it becomes exponentially harder to read. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*I might find a solution to this in the future*
